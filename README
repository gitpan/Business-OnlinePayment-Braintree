DESCRIPTION
    Online payment processing through Braintree based on Net::Braintree.

NOTES
    This is a very basic implementation right now and only for development
    purposes. It is supposed to cover the complete Braintree Perl API
    finally.

METHODS
  submit
    Submits transaction to Braintree gateway.

  sale $submit
    Performs sale transaction with Braintree. Used both for settlement
    ($submit is a true value) and authorization ($submit is a false value).
